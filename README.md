# Advanced Redux Toolkit Project

This is a demo project built with **React** and **Redux Toolkit**.

It demonstrates advanced usage of Redux Toolkit for managing global state, including:

- Using `createSlice` to simplify reducers and actions
- Managing cart state with multiple actions (add, remove)
- Toggling UI state (e.g., showing/hiding the cart)
- Clean and modular file structure
