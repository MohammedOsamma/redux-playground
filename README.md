# Redux Playground

This repository contains two separate mini-projects showcasing my hands-on practice with **Redux** and **Redux Toolkit**.

---

## 📁 Branches Overview

### 🔹 `redux`
A simple demo project to practice **Redux basics**:
- Managing state using actions & reducers
- Connecting components with the Redux store
- Dispatching actions from components

> Useful for understanding how Redux works under the hood without any abstraction.

---

### 🔹 `advanced-redux-toolkit`
A more advanced project that applies **Redux Toolkit** for real-world scenarios:
- Using `createSlice` for cleaner reducer logic
- Async logic with `createAsyncThunk`
- Handling loading, error, and success states
- Better file and store organization

> Shows how Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux boilerplate and improves development efficiency.

## 🚀 How to Run

You can switch between the two branches to explore each project:

```bash
git checkout redux
npm install
npm start
